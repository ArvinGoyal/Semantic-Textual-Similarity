We have wrttien ten different models (baseline and extensions). All the models used based on LSTM we used GloVe embedding 
we have saved all our dataset, model code and saved model on google drive. Path has been shared in 

To run or load our saved models we need to mount the google drive (which has dataset and saved models) in colab.
We have to change the working directory path appropriatly to point mounted google drive where we have required files.
